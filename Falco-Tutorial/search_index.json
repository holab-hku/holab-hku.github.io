["index.html", "Falco Tutorial Chapter 1 About the Workshop", " Falco Tutorial Ho Lab 2019-12-11 Chapter 1 About the Workshop Falco is a software bundle that enables bioinformatic analysis of large-scale transcriptomic data by utilizing public cloud infrastructure. The framework currently provide supports for single cell RNA feature quantification, alignment and transcript assembly analyses. This tutorial guides the user through the steps necessary to perform an analysis. It is assumed that any shell commands are executed using a bash shell. üî¥ Note that this tutorial will require you to either create a new AWS S3 bucket, or use an existing bucket. As a result, these instructions will require you to replace occurrences of the word yourbucket (or [YOUR BUCKET]) with the name of the bucket you have created or chosen to use - at various points in the instructions. This tutorial is estimated to take up to 45 mins to complete. There is a step in this tutorial that launches the necessary computing resources on AWS. This step takes approximately 20 minutes to complete. Once verified that this step has started, the user can come back to the tutorial in 20 minutes to proceed with the remainder of the tutorial. üî¥ It is estimated that the cost of this tutorial, charged to your AWS account, will be less than $5 USD. Make sure you follow the instructions to terminate the session once you have completed the tutorial. "],
["getting-started.html", "Chapter 2 Getting Started 2.1 Prerequisites 2.2 AWS setup", " Chapter 2 Getting Started This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally. To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps. 2.1 Prerequisites It is assumed the user has downloaded the Falco framework and has extracted the files to a location of their choice onto a Linux operating system environment. This location will be referred to as the local resource, and the directory on the local resource that contains the LICENSE file from the Falco framework will be referred to as the home directory. Files related to this tutorial can be found in the tutorial directory. Clone the repo git clone https://github.com/VCCRI/Falco.git Set path export Falco=/path/to/Falco_dir If your system does not have Python 3 installed, refer to https://python.org for the relevant documentation. The Python library boto3 is required to be installed. boto3 provides a programming interface to AWS services. To install boto3 for Python 3, issue the following command (Debian/Ubuntu): sudo python3 -m pip install boto3 If this command fails due to pip not being installed, the following commands work on Debian/Ubuntu related Linux systems: # update system software sudo apt-get update # install pip for python 2 sudo apt-get install python-pip # install pip for python 3 sudo apt-get install python3-pip 2.2 AWS setup 2.2.1 AWS account If you are not part of an organisation that can provide you with IAM credentials, you will need to create an AWS account. Note that for this and subsequent AWS setup steps, this Getting Started with AWS documentation will be helpful. 2.2.2 Obtain an AWS secret key If you are not the AWS administrator, ask your AWS administrator for AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key. Log in to your AWS Management Console](http://aws.amazon.com/). Click on your user name at the top right of the page. Click on the Security Credentials link from the drop-down menu. Find the Access Credentials section, and copy the latest Access Key ID. Click on the Show link in the same row, and copy the Secret Access Key. 2.2.3 Install the AWS Linux Client (AWS CLI) The AWS CLI is a command line tool that interfaces to the AWS resources such as EC2 instances, EMR clusters, and S3 storage buckets. sudo pip install awscli 2.2.4 Configuring AWS Linux Client Once installed, an initial configuration is required: aws configure When prompted, enter your Access Key ID and Secret Access Key, and default AWS region. Press Enter when prompted for output type if you are not sure about this element. 2.2.5 Obtain an AWS EC2 key Obtain the AWS EC2 key name that will be used to control access to the instances that comprise the EMR cluster. A key will have an extension .pem. If you are familiar with AWS, you may already have an AWS EC2 key. Otherwise, you may create a key with these instructions. 2.2.6 Obtain access to or create an AWS S3 bucket Create an S3 bucket for use with Falco. aws s3api create-bucket --bucket [YOUR BUCKET] --region us-west-1 --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=us-west-1 Replace [YOUR BUCKET] with your own bucket name. Also replace us-west-1 if you would prefer to use a different region. Once created, use the AWS CLI high level S3 commands to work with your bucket - e.g. copy files to or from your bucket, list the contents of your bucket, etc. Additionally, AWS provides a web interface to S3 (and other services).

You will need to first create an AMI using the code in https://github.com/VCCRI/Falco/tree/master/source/ami_creator, by first launching the EC2 instance using launch-ec2.sh script (and then making sure that everything is installed properly), followed by running the create-image.sh script. When you run the create-image.sh script, it will create a new file called custom_ami_id.txt which will contain the custom AMI ID you will need to put into the custom_ami_id option in emr_cluster.config file. Once you have specified the custom_ami_id, you can set bootstrap_scripts option to just copy_reference.sh (instead of install_software.sh, copy_reference.sh).

Change these placeholders to your values. In a bash shell, from the Falco home directory, edit and submit the following command:[‚ùóÔ∏è] # preplace the bracketed sections with your details sed -i.bak &#39;s/username/[YOUR USER NAME]/g ; s/yourbucket/[YOUR BUCKET NAME]/g&#39; tutorial/*.config # EXAMPLE ONLY: if your user name if &quot;fred&quot; and your AWS bucket is &quot;falco-test&quot;, then you would use the following command #sed -i.bak &#39;s/username/fred/g ; s/yourbucket/falco-test/g&#39; tutorial/*.config sed -i.bak.reg &#39;s/us-west-2/[YOUR REGION]/g&#39; tutorial/*.config # change [YOUR REGION] to the name of your region # EXAMPLE (if your region is us-west-1): sed -i.bak.reg &#39;s/us-west-2/us-west-1/g&#39; tutorial/*.config The original .config files in the tutorial directory will now have the file extension .config.bak should you wish to restore the original files. ‚ùóFirst open the file tutorial/emr_cluster.config. vi tutorial/emr_cluster.config Change the release_label to the latest version: release_label = emr-5.27.0 Change the bootstrap_scripts to only copy_reference.sh: bootstrap_scripts = copy_reference.sh Adding the line in the below: # If custom AMI ID is specified, it is recommended to remove install_software.sh from thr bootstrap scripts as the custom AMI should already have these installed. custom_ami_id = ami-0f48840896db32bf0 and check that [EMR_nodes] section is similar to the following: [EMR_nodes] key_name = yourkey service_role = EMR_DefaultRole instance_profile = EMR_EC2_DefaultRole master_instance_type = m5.4xlarge master_instance_count = 1 core_instance_type = m5.4xlarge core_instance_count = 2 core_instance_spot = True core_instance_bid_price = 1 The [EMR_nodes] section contains a line that starts with key_name =. The computing resources created by the AWS EMR framework uses public‚Äìkey cryptography to encrypt and decrypt login information. You need to supply your key name here. For example, if your encryption key file is my-key-name.pem, the corresponding line in the configuration file should read key_name = my-key-name. [‚ùóÔ∏è]Go ahead and edit this entry - enter your key name.[üî¥][ Also be aware of the charges that you may incur from AWS for the creation of this cluster. The master instance will be an on-demand type, whilst the two core instances are spot instance types. It is estimated the cost of the cluster for this tutorial, if terminated within 1 hour, will be less than $5 USD. This cost is based on the AWS region us-west-2 - US West (Oregon). 6.2 Launch the AWS EMR cluster When ready, in the home directory of the Falco code, issue the following command to start the cluster: [‚ùóÔ∏è] python3 launch_cluster.py --config tutorial/emr_cluster.config When the command is processed, the user will receive a response, of the form: Cluster has been launched with ID j-1FDPU9CHN79W9 Make a note of your cluster ID for future reference. 6.3 Monitor the EMR Cluster [‚ùóÔ∏è] Monitor the status of the EMR cluster via the AWS EMR console. When the status of your cluster is Ready, you may proceed with the steps required for completing the analysis. Click on your cluster to obtain more information about your cluster. [üî¥] Since the nodes that are launched as part of this cluster use AWS spot instance types, it is possible that the market price for the instances exceeds the bid price. If this is the case, then the cluster will not start until the market price falls below the bid price. You can monitor the market price for the spot instances via the AWS EC2 Mangement Console. You can decide if you want to terminate your EMR cluster and either try again later, or modify the bid price in the file tutorial/emr_cluster.config. 6.4 Upload the Manifest file Falco requires a manifest file to list the FASTQ filenames representing the data input. The required format is a tab delimited text file. This file has been provided for this tutorial and is located at tutorial/data.manifest. Upload the manifest file to your AWS S3 bucket: [‚ùóÔ∏è] # issue this command from the Falco home directory aws s3 cp tutorial/data.manifest s3://[YOUR BUCKET]/falco-tutorial/data.manifest # replace [YOUR BUCKET] with the name of your bucket [üî¥]The following three instructions that launch jobs can be issued one after the other - without waiting for the previous job to finish. The EMR framework will launch jobs in order, and only after the previous job has completed. 6.5 Launch the Split job The split job takes the original data and splits it into smaller sized files for more efficient processing by Falco. The original input data stored on AWS S3 will not be removed. The modified data will be stored in a new AWS S3 location as specified in the configuration file tutorial/split_job.config. Type the following command at a command prompt in the Falco home directory:[‚ùóÔ∏è] python3 submit_split_job.py --config tutorial/split_job.config 6.6 Launch the Pre-processing job In Falco, the pre-processing step is optional. However, for this tutorial, an example pre-processing script is provided, and this step is compulsory to complete the tutorial as configured. First examine the configuration file tutorial/preprocessing_job.config. The config file specifies which bash scripts are used for the pre-processing. You may wish to also examine these scripts to see how the pre-processing works in this case. Type the following at a command prompt from the Falco home directory: [‚ùóÔ∏è] python3 submit_preprocessing_job.py --config tutorial/preprocessing_job.config 6.7 Launch the Analysis job This is the main analysis job that processes the pre-processed data to determine the counts of features. The output be two .csv files: the actual counts of features, and a separate file detailing quality assurance statistics relating to these counts. The configuration file tutorial/analysis_job.config contains the settings for the analysis job with STAR as the aligner and featureCount for quantification - including any extra parameters for the tools used. The configuration file also specifies the AWS S3 location for the final output .csv files. Enter the following at a command prompt from the Falco home directory: [‚ùóÔ∏è] python3 submit_analysis_job.py --config tutorial/analysis_job.config [üî¥] To change the alignment and/or quantification tool used in the analysis job, simply modify the aligner_tool and counter_tool option in the analysis configuration file (analysis_job.config). 6.8 Monitor Steps Note that, as long as the above three steps (split, preprocess, and analysis) are entered in that order, the steps may be entered one after the other - without having to wait until the previous step finishes. The EMR framework ensures that a step does not start until the previously queued step has completed. [‚ùóÔ∏è] Monitor the status of each step using the AWS EMR console - in the Step section. 6.9 Monitor S3 files Use the AWS S3 Console to monitor files in your S3 bucket. 6.10 Download results and Terminate Cluster To download a file from AWS S3 to your current directory, edit the following command with your details and execute at a shell command line: [‚ùóÔ∏è] aws s3 cp s3://[YOUR BUCKET]/falco-tutorial/[YOUR USER NAME]/analysis/samples_expression.csv . # you can also list all the AWS S3 files that begin with a particular prefix: #aws s3 ls s3://[YOUR BUCKET]/falco-tutorial/[YOUR USER NAME]/analysis/ Alternatively, you could see a listing of the results via the AWS S3 Console by navigating to your bucket and output location. [üî¥]As AWS charges by the hour for usage of its services, the user should terminate their cluster when finished. This is done by selecting your cluster on the AWS EMR console Cluster List, and clicking the Terminate button. "],
